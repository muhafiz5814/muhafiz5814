**Hi there 👋**

If you are coming from LinkedIn or my Resume, then you probably know my name 😀, but if not, let me itroduce myself 🙂.

<h1 align="center">My Self, Muhafiz Raza🤝</h1>

- I’m a developer 👨‍💻 specialized in MERN stack.
- Recently learned `TypeScript`, currently learning `Tailwind CSS` and all of this, is to learn `Next.js`, which is the main target 🎯 (As most of the projects in Next.js are using these technologies).
-  Participated in GSSoC Extended 2024 open source program and contributed to some awesome projects. [Click here](https://github.com/muhafiz5814?tab=overview&from=2024-10-01&to=2024-10-31#:~:text=Contribution%20activity), then scroll to `Contribution activity` section to see my contribution history of program below 👇.
-  Learning new things 👨‍💻 and helping my parents 👨‍👩‍👦 in the day, applying my learning in projects in the night (mostly). Due to this you can notice my most commits are made at night 🌃.
-  If you see many continuous empty squares⬛ in my contribution history in recent days/weeks, check again after some time, I am just a PR away 🙂.

### Note
>  Repositories starting with word `hello-` are my learning repositories. Whenever I start learning new technology I simply create a new repo for it and start learning by building.  
>  Any PRs or Reviews on `hello-` repository are my own. Doing this to make sure I practice as Project Admin as well as Contributor/Developer in project.
